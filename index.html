  <h2>Things you should know:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Albums that were released during Taylor Swift's record deal with Big Machine Records have or will have a Taylor's Version. This is because Big Machine Records sold the masters (original recordings) of those first six albums, so she does not make money off of them. She signed a deal with Universal's Republic Records in November of 2018, so now she owns her own masters. You can read more about it <a href="https://time.com/5949979/why-taylor-swift-is-rerecording-old-albums/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
    <li>'The Vault' is where all of the songs that Taylor wrote for an album but didn't get put on the album figuratively are. So, when you a see a single that is 'From the Vault', it was going to be on the album, but then she released it later as a single or in the Taylor's Version of that album. 'From the Vault' songs are still part of the era of the album they were written for. Or, in the case of albums, it just means that it hasn't been released yet. For example, Taylor's Versions that haven't been released yet are in the Vault.</li>
    <li>This Explorer does not include any of Taylor Swift's Christmas songs/albums, as they don't really belong to any specific era.</li>
    <li>In the tracklists, there are no '(Taylor's Version)' added to the end of each song, even if there is a Taylor's Version, because it would take to long and I'm lazy. There are also no singles for the same reason. However, '(From The Vault)' is still added when a song is from the Vault in order to differentiate.</li>
